# My portfolio

This is the repository for my portfolio webpage!
Seeing as I'm currently working on it there is no link to it yet.
However! If you'd like to check it out for yourself, you still can!

You'll need React and npm. Clone the repo and in the terminal of the project type "npm install".
This will install all the necessary packages I've used, such as Tailwind and react-router-dom.

Now you just enter "npm run dev" into the terminal and you'll be given a link to my website hosted on your own computer!

I will build and make a official link for my protfolio as soon as I've reached a stage I feel comfortable with people seeing the "finished" product ;D
